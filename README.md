This repository holds the HTML/JS source for building a graph showing the books and movies reviewed by The Pavement Pounders on our podcast, Take Me To Your Reader.  http://www.pavementpodcast.com

## TODO

* Add lines to the book data.  This is to help show that there will never be movies below this line.
* Try to autogenerate the graph data by using the Google Spreadsheet as a data source.  (Don't expose API keys or other authentication information).
* Make the graph kinda self-hosting by pushing content to a branch called gh-pages.  See this page for reference: https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/
  * Could rename the master branch to gh-pages, and book_adaptation_graph.html to index.html, then the graph would automatically be available at http(s)://perldreamer.github.io/Podcast-Graph
* Convert TODO items into github issues
* Consider using the forked version of jqplot at https://github.com/svandecappelle/jQPlot for additional updates, features and bugfixes.
