This repository holds the HTML/JS source for building a graph showing the books and movies reviewed by The Pavement Pounders on our podcast, Take Me To Your Reader.  http://www.pavementpodcast.com

## TODO

* Add lines to the book data.  This is to help show that there will never be movies below this line.
* Try to autogenerate the graph data by using the Google Spreadsheet as a data source.  (Don't expose API keys or other authentication information).
* Convert TODO items into github issues
* Refactor the JSON data so there's no duplication in the arrays.  Dynamically build both of them from some non-uniform initial data structure.
