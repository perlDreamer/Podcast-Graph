This repository holds the HTML/JS source for building a graph showing the books and movies reviewed by The Pavement Pounders on our podcast, Take Me To Your Reader.  http://www.pavementpodcast.com

## TODO

* Add lines to the book data.  This is to help show that there will never be movies below this line.

* Try to autogenerate the graph data by using the Google Spreadsheet as a data source.  (Don't expose API keys or other authentication information).
